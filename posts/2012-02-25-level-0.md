Level 0 is a Snake II (think old-ish Nokia phones) clone written in Haskell, using SDL. `cloc` tells me it's 301 LOC, in addition to 49 comments which I'm happy with.


I'll make a pretty video, project page etc. once I've gathered enough effort,
for now, you can simply view the code [on
GitHub](https://github.com/mikeplus64/Level-0).
