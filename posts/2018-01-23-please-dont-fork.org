Hackage has, for years, set apart the Haskell ecosystem from its competitors. In
recent discussions I think it's clear that people don't appreciate just *how
good* we've got it in Haskell-land, right now:

1. We have a single centralised repository of *all* Haskell packages that people
   have been happily using for /years/ now.

2. That centralised repository generates *API* documentation for *all* the
   packages (at least, the ones that build successfully, and don't run into e.g.
   a Haddock bug) uploaded.

We should not take either of these for granted. Despite years of contention over
aspects of Hackage, this is a seriously /good/ state of affairs.
