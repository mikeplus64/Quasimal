Respecify is a novel web-based requirements authoring tool developed by me, for
[[http://transportengineering.com.au][Transport Engineering]], utilising constrained natural language.

Respecify aids requirements engineers by applying a simple English grammar that
ensures:
1. Basic syntactic correctness.
2. All terms within a specification are defined and have at most 1 meaning.
3. The relationships specified do not contradict eachother.
4. Requirements meet some basic quality checks.

We have found in practise that this simple approach can be a huge step-up from
the current state-of-the-art of using Excel spreadsheets.

A [[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8049164/][tool demonstration]] was published for [[http://re2017.org/][RE'17]].
