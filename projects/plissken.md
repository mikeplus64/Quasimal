Plissken is Snake - in 3D. You have to control the snake in 3 dimensions. This
was mostly made midway through 2013, written in Haskell, using `hmatrix` (though I
started two projects [^1][^2] that I hope to eventually replace hmatrix here with)
along with `GLFW-b`, `FTGL` and `OpenGLRaw` (among others).

Plissken notably includes a .obj loader, a novel method of registering shaders
and the uniforms they require in a type-safe way, and a level editor.
