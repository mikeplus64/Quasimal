Teamsplat generates fair teams for 2-team games by brute-forcing all the
possible alternatives. The backend uses Servant and either PostgreSQL (because
Heroku needed it) or SQLite. The frontend is a bloated single-page application
notably using Grommet and Flowtype.

Teamsplat uses [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson-flowtyped][aeson-flowtyped]] -- another project of mine -- to generate
flowtype type declarations for the JSON API that the backend exposes.

Available online [[https://teamsplat.herokuapp.com][on Heroku]] and [[https://github.com/mikeplus64/teamsplat][on GitHub]].
